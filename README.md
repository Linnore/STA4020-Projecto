# STA4020-Projecto

## To initialize this repo:
git clone https://github.com/Linnore/STA4020-Projecto.git

## Pipeline
1. First model, the fixed bayes estimate model is in `bayes_portfolio.ipynb` - model A

2. Second model, the time-variance risk-preference bayes estimate model is in `bayes_portfolio.ipynb` - model B

3. Third model, the momentuem filter with smoothing kernel is in `basic_risk_budgeting.ipynb`

4. Forth model, the momentum filter with bayes kernel is in `bayes_portfolio.ipynb` - model D

Risk budgeting model, is in `./utils/mean_variance.py`


Other pipelines: see *.ipynb
## Utilities
*.py file in the folder utils

## Notes of the data folder:

* Please organize the data within the `data` folder, and organize codes `.py` files within `utils` folder. 
* Feel free to contact @Linnore for implementation details!
